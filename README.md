<h1>MilkScript</h1>
<i>An overall tutorial on how to use it.</i>

<h1>FOR CONTRIBUTORS</h1>
For those who want to upgrade the code within the
MilkScript repo (since I am a horrid programmer)
it's best I go over the git repo. The following
describes each directory:<br><br>


    examples/ - This is a folder where all the example files go in.
    parser/ - This is an upcoming version of the parser, written in Go.
    res/ - Just resources for stuff like the README file.
    test_parser/ - A beta/alpha version of the parser, written in Python.


<h1>FOR DEVELOPERS</h1>
MilkScript is stack-based, so a majority
of data you wish to save will be thrown
on there. To push to the stack, use the
<code>pour</code> command to pour data
onto the stack.<br>Here's an example:<br><br>


    pour(Hello, world!);
