# The MilkScript Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I'm pretty sure ALL versions should be supported
so I'm not gonna bother with this section
at all.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerbality within the code,
please do make an issue that uses the issue template.
BUT, if you believe the vulnerbality is likely to be
exploited, you can keep it private by sending an
email to HaxeFloppa himself at rafaelandyhailu@gmail.com.
