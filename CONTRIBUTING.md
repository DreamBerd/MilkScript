  <h1>FOR CONTRIBUTORS</h1>
For those who want to upgrade the code within the
MilkScript repo (since I am a horrid programmer)
it's best I go over the git repo. The following
describes each directory:<br><br>


    examples/ - This is a folder where all the example files go in.
    parser/ - This is an upcoming version of the parser, written in Go.
    res/ - Just resources for stuff like the README file.
    test_parser/ - A beta/alpha version of the parser, written in Python.

MilkScript also has a branch protection rule. It's pretty simple but could
change over time considering this project has only just started. Then again,
this project is a sort of half-joke so it doesn't need to be taken seriously,
hence the simple branch protection (being only push request approval). That's
all I guess. You can just contribute all you want now.. I suppose.
